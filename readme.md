# nfts-contracts

basic implementation of an ERC721 token.

built with [dapp tools](https://dapp.tools).

## getting started

install dapp tools [here](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation). (Linux or WSL on Windows works best, there may be an issue with some Macbooks and the Nix dependency).

from the root directory run:

  - `dapp build` to compile the contracts
  - `dapp test` to run the tests

## main contracts
